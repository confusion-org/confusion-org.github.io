She was towed by Jem's motor Severn and survived      her stern post cracking from top to bottom, a trip on the Thames and making it past the BW lockkeeper at the bottom of the Grand Union.</p>      <p class="pmrs">With a bit of patching of the bottom she was stable enough to be left floating until space became available. She was then pulled out and the ice-plating stripped      from the bow to make a full assessment of what needed doing.</p>      <p class="pmrs">Meanwhile, we started to look for timber. Two standing dead oak trees were located, one in Kent and the other on a pumping station in Grantchester. These were duly      purchased and by a complicated set of organization, milled into 3" thick bottom boards using two portable sawmills, one at each site on the same day. The timber was taken to the      boatyard in two loads on a 7.5t dropside lorry and then the boards were manhandled into a stack.</p>      <p class="pmrs">Assessment of her condition showed that a number of bottom boards were needed, together with a new kelson. These were fitted before moving the boat further inland for      replanking.</p>      <p class="pmrs">We then started on the new side planks. In total the stem and stern posts, most of the curved planks and all the waterline planks down each side were replaced. This work      spanned about two years, working every other weekend.</p>      <p class="pmrs">The boat was then caulked across the seams by feeding in oakum (hemp fibre soaked in Stockholm Tar) and hammering it home. In total three 50lb bales of Oakum were      required. The hull was then coated in hot tar.</p>      <p class="pmrs">Meanwhile, the inside of the boat was re-sheared. Shearing is thin strips of wood nailed top to bottom of the sides. The side is first coated with a layer of tar/pitch/horse dung      mixture which forms a flexible putty and this is coated with sheathing felt and then the shearing. The shearing is nailed down to stop the caulking coming through.</p>      <p class="pmrs">The boat was then filled with water to swell up the seams. When she held water without leaking (too much!) the stern tube was fitted ready for motorising. Swim plates      were added to the sides to stop the propellor cavitating. The top flashes were painted and the name repainted. The hull was finally launched in March 2002.</p>                  <p class="pmrs">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="pmrs">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="15%" align="right">      <p class="pmrs" align="right"><font size="1">Click on the thumbnails below      to view a larger image</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_bow.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_bow.jpg" alt="Bow after removing ice plates" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_stern.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_stern.jpg" alt="Stern after removing rot" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_tree_kent.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_tree_kent.jpg" alt="Felled tree for bottom boards in Kent" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_bottom.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_bottom.jpg" alt="Patching bottom boards" width="64" height="85"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_steaming.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_steaming.jpg" alt="Steaming a bow plank" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_caulking1.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_caulking1.jpg" alt="Caulking the chine" width="64" height="85"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_caulking2.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_caulking2.jpg" alt="Caulking shakes" width="64" height="85"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_caulking3.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_caulking3.jpg" alt="Caulking bow" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_shearing.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_shearing.jpg" alt="Preparing for shearing" width="64" height="85"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/restoration/hagley_puttenham_launch.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_launch.jpg" alt="Launching at last" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
