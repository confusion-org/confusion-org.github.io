These      are partly to provide a platform and partly to stiffen up the bow and stern by bracing across      the hull as a triangle. The decks are constructed from 5x3" beams with 1.5" planking and a       layer of shearing on top.</p>      <p class="pmrs">The original cabin was approximately 7' long to maximize hold space. Since the boat      is being rebuilt mainly as a pleasure boat, the cabin will be extended and will include space for an engine.      The cabin will be framed with 5x3" oak and an external layer of ply or marine grade MDF. During their       working lives Grand Union boats were painted in many liveries, we've opted for the simplified "Austerity"      colours, partly because it makes the signwriting easier!</p>      <p class="pmrs">The front part of the cabin will be converted under cloths with demountable boards and loose      furniture. This arrangement will allow the carrying of up to 40' loads (and makes it easier to move everything      out of the way to find the leaks!).</p>      <p class="pmrs">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="pmrs">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="15%" align="right">      <p class="pmrs" align="right"><font size="1">Click on the thumbnails below      to view a larger image</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/cabin/hagley_puttenham_foredeck.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_foredeck.jpg" alt="Foredeck construction" width="64" height="48"></a></tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
