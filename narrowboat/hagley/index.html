Planking is over iron frames on the straight sides with      oak frames at the bow and stern to give extra shaping. Hagley was designed with deep sides to carry boxed cargo from the Thames.</p>      <p class="pmrs">When we were given Hagley she had been used for many years as a houseboat on the Basingstoke Canal. She was then deconverted and was lying as a bare hull by Scotland Road Bridge. She was barely floating and needed immediate docking and       an extensive programme of restoration.</p>      <p class="pmrs">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="pmrs">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="15%" align="right">      <p class="pmrs" align="right"><font size="1">Click on the thumbnails below      to view a larger image</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/index/hagley_basingstoke_bow.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_basingstoke_bow.jpg" alt="Hagley as found on the Basingstoke" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/index/hagley_basingstoke_stern.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_basingstoke_stern.jpg" alt="Hagley as found on the Basingstoke" width="64" height="85"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/index/hagley_puttenham_bow.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_bow.jpg" alt="Bow after removing ice plates" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/index/hagley_puttenham_launch.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_launch.jpg" alt="Launching at last" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"><a href="images/index/hagley_puttenham_steered.htm"><img border="0" src="images/thumb/hagley_puttenham_steered.jpg" alt="Hagley being pulled down the Aylesbury arm" width="64" height="48"></a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="right"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
