<p>This is a (probably inconplete) diary of the weekend. If you think I
have left anything out then please <a href=mailto:clare@confusion.org>email me

<h3>Friday</h3>

<p>Ben. Louise and Clare met at Cambridge station at around 4pm and
caught the train to London. They then crossed London and on arriving
at Paddington found that there was an Intercity train leaving very
shortly. They got on this train and were comfortably settled when
there was an announcement on the tannoy to the effect that their
tickets were not valid on this train so they got off again quickly
before the train could leave! They then found that there was a Thames
Train also to Reading leaving in about 3 minutes time! So they made a
manic dash across the station and just managed to make it. Although
instead of nice comfortable seats they had to sit on the floor.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Alec and Andrew had been shopping in Tesco but had
managed to forget the West Indian Hot Pepper Sauce - a vital thing on
any narrowboat holiday! So having met Jonathan at Andrew's house,
Andrew set of by bike to the boat and Jonathan and Alec make a trip to
Waitrose to get the sauce, amusing the checkout girl considerably in
the process!</p>

<p>Andrew, Alec and Jonathan eventually made it to the boat and Clare,
Louise and Ben made it very soon afterwards having walked from the
station (where they had managed to get something to eat including some
very welcome pizza) and actually managed not to get lost despite
Andrew's wonderful directions of 'wiggle right a bit and then left a
bit'!</p>

<p>On arrival at the baot, we unloaded Alec's car and Alec then drove
back to Andrew's, left the car there and cycled back to the boat.</p>

<p>That evening was spent mainly in comsuming two thirds of the weekend's
cider supply and half the cheese whilst playing (for a suitably loose
definition of the word) 'Cluedo Super Slueth'. This seemed to involve
mainly Andrew being unable to remember the rules, Alec attempting to
play it like bridge (a not altogether successful strategy) and lots of
people making dodgy 'suggestions' (<u>not</u> accusations!) to other
people,
such as 'It was X in the engine room with Y and the rope...' The game
eventually 'finished' when we decided that it was 3am, no-one had a
clue what was going on and we were all knackered! (due to all those
antics in the engine room, no doubt - ed).</p>

<hr>

<h3>Saturday</h3>

Woke up (or got woken up) at far too early an hour. Andrew had to go
and feed the cats so we waited for him to get back and then set off at
about 9am. We went down the Thames to Caversham lock, which was
unmanned. Alec then had to work the lock which was consequently much
slower but we got through in the end. The
lock keeper turned up just as we were leaving and closed the gates for
us. We then stopped at Tescos where Clare and Alec went to replenish the
sadly depleted cheese and cider supplies. Everyone else carried on and
the boat turned off right onto the Kennet and then into Blake's lock where
Clare and Alec caught them up.</p>

<p>The next notable event was the sighting of Richard on the towpath as a
load cry of 'ALLLLLLLLLL the Lads!' alerted us to his presence. Using
the well known 'zig-zag tecnique' we went left to pick him up,
right to press the traffic light button and then on through the windy
stretch (hence the need for traffic lights). When it was pointed out
to Richard that he was supposed to have 'phoned us from the station he
seemed completely unaware of this and in fact had completely failed to
bring the mobile number with him which Andrew had 'phoned especially
to give him the day before! It may be noted that Richard made many
contributions to the weekend, not least of them being to shout at cows, a
train and a herd of geese.. No, we don't know
why either - although we suspect that he may be regressing to his 'anal
phase'.</p>

<p>We then went through County lock where Clare tried pushing the bottom
gate when the top gates had just been closed, forgetting that you have to
let the water out first! (well, if they will build these locks with a
fall of about a foot 
so you can't see the difference then what do they expect! - ed). We
carried on up the river to Fobney lock which was vast, about 96' by 18',
and very slow. This was followed by dead fish lock, so called beacuse
Richard and Jonathan managed to fish a dead fish out of the
chamber and balance it 
on the bottom lock gate. (Apparently this lock is actually called
'Tile Mill Lock' - I think 'Dead Fish Lock' sound much better - ed).</p>

<p>Next came Theale Lock which was scalloped, which whilst looking very
pretty this meant that the top gate balance beam couldn't actually be
reached when open as it hung out over the water! This was followed by a
swing bridge, the first of many! This
was perhaps the most impressive one though, in that we managed to hold
up a queue of about 30 cars in both directions as it was electrically
operated and very very slow! At this point, another
boat came through the bridge with us, and joined us for most of the
rest of the day. We continued on together to the next lock, which was
de-gated and had a swing bridge. (Clare had the fun of doing this
swing bridge all on her own, which involved some amusing antics
getting from one side to the other!).</p>

<p>The next lock we encountered was 9'6'' deep, and had the amusing
property of being a little enthusiastic when filling wih the gate paddles 
opened. Those sitting
inside the boat were treated to a view of an impressive waterfall
coming over the front and were extremely glad that they had shut the
front door about 30 seconds earlier! As it was some water still leaked
through the grating in the door!</p>

<p>Having recovered from the minor flood we progressed to Aldermaston (it
may be noted here that due to the boat undergoing repainting at the time 
one side was a nice shade of battleship grey. This promtped Alec to use
black insulation tape
to write U32 on the side of the boat in an attempt to become the
first narrow boat ever to be torpedoed. Strangely enough, this didn't
happen..). Lift Bridge on the A340, which was rather impressive and
this was followed by another scalloped lock. Soon after this, the
other boat stopped to get some petrol (they were running on an
outboard motor). Just before they left we discovered that the fact we
were both mad enough to be out in November wasn't the only thing we
had in common - both crews also had a Morris Minor owner!</p>

<p>By this stage, it was getting fairly dark. Ben, Louise and Alec walked
along the towpath operating the locks to Thatcham where we moored up for
the
night - eventually - finding a place deep enough to moor was quite a
challenge! We also experimented with a variant on 'harmonica fishing'
here, when Andrew managed to drop the torch into the canal.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent cooking and eating dinner and then
going to the PUB! called 'The Ship' to use the 'facilities' and drink
some Old Peculiar, before going back to the boat and going to bed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<p>We set off back the way we had come, at a rather later time than the
previous day, people having actually managed to get some sleep! Andrew
got the boat going soon to be joined by Ben and Clare. Meanwhile Alec
and Richard made the traditional bacon and egg sandwiches for
breakfast, which finished off the remains of the Hot Pepper Sauce.</p>

<p>It was raining. Lots. The somewhat reduced lock team lost a little
of their Total Organisation at this point as everyone went on to the
next lock before opening the gates for the boat to get out of the one
it was in!  But Mr Covlin saved the day, prompting Richard to shout
"Cor! Speedy shark!"</p>

<p>A chapter of accidents followed at this point, with a tree knocking off
the top off one of the gas cylinder boxes into the canal so we had to go back and collect it, using the pole. Soon after
this, Richard appeared at the back of the boat to tell Andrew rather
sheepishly that he had managed to break a window by trying to empty
the bacon fat from the grill pan into the canal through it!</p>

<p>We carried on through lots of rain and lots of locks. Just after the
lift bridge we met a small fibreglass boat going the same way as us. They
not only managed to to remove the entire of the top of their boat at
one lock in a quite impressive crash, but also knocked of one of their
fenders! Luckily this was retrieved for them by Clare with the help of
some friendly canoeists. This boat accompanied us all the way back to
the Thames.</p>

<p>We reached Garston Lock,this is a unique turf sided lock and has been
restored by BW. Being turf sided means it leaks and hence took about
30mins to fill, at about lunch
time. The trouble with turf sided locks, is that the sides have a 45
degree angle as they rise, so they need a <u>lot</u> of water to fill them
up! Given the amount of time it took to fill, we felt it should become
unique by being the only quick setting cement sided lock. We then met
our only other boat of the day at the degated lock, coming the other
way so fortunately we didn't have to wind the thing back again. Seeing
as it takes 68 turns each time this was welcome.</o>

<p>By the time we arrived at Dead Fish Lock, it was after 4pm and dark.
Alec finally gave up driving to go in and get some lunch. Clare at
some point decided that plastic gloves would be a good idea as she
wrang out her wool ones for about the fiftieth time that day.</p>

<p>We then came into the outskirts of Reading with Alec driving again,
and Ben walking along the roof of the boat with a torch to point out
the branches sticking out into the canal. We got to County Lock at
5.15 at which point Jonathan and Richard left us as they both wanted
to get home at a reasonable time. We went straight on through the
traffic lights, which were with us since there wasn't be anyone else mad
enough to be out at 5.30 on a
Sunday like this! However the lock keeper at Blake's lock was about,
although fortunately for the fibreglass boat he didn't come out and notice
their missing licence!</p>

<p>We then turned onto the Thames and headed upstream. We came back
through Caversham lock which had unfortunately had the power supply
turned off so Alec got to wind the handle many many
times again to make it go. Nearly home, we headed up under Reading
bridge. Just after this, Andrew decided to test the turning circle of
the boat - not bad, as it managed to turn around completely in the
channel in one go! Finally, we came up under Caversham Bridge and
safely back to the mooring where we once again said 'hello' to the
swans.</p>

<p>Alec set off on Andrew's bike to go and collect his car. The ride was
a little hard, and this turned out to be due to a punctured rear
tyre. This made it rather tricky riding down hills as the wheel didn't
want to stay in line in the rain. In the meantime, Andrew, Clare, Ben
and Louise tidied up the boat and got thankfully changed into the
things they had that most closely resembled the description of 'dry'.
Alec arrived back just as Clare, Ben and Louise were setting off to
walk to the station. By managing to retrieve a couple of left over
cans, he manged the impressive feat of drinking nothing but beer
between Friday lunchtime and Monday morning! Alec gave Andrew a lift
home and Clare, Ben and Louise got the train back to Cambridge.</p>

<p>And there ended a sometimes wet, sometimes sunny, often cold but very
enjoyable weekend on the canal.</p>
